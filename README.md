### Security: Verify before running

To verify the integrity of `dl.sh` before running it:

```zsh
# Download the script without executing
curl -o dl.sh __RAW_BASE_URL__/dl.sh

# Verify SHA256 hash matches the one below
shasum -a 256 dl.sh

# Inspect the script content
cat dl.sh

# Inspect what will be installed
curl -s __RAW_BASE_URL__/dl-util/install_and_sync.sh | less

## Project notes

- Data: Describe where data comes from and any preprocessing requirements.
- Experiment: Outline the main analysis/experiment steps and expected outputs.
- Environment: Dependencies are managed with uv (see dl-util/install_and_sync.sh for details).

## Next steps

- Edit this README to document your specific analysis.
- See the original template guide in README.template.md for advanced usage and maintenance tips.
- Optionally delete the template_images/ folder in dl-util/ and the README.template.md. (but don't delete other files in dl-util/)

## uv Usage hints

- Add a Python package with `uv add <package-name>`
- Create a local virtual environment `.venv` from the `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files. (already done by install script)
- Run a Python file using the local environment with `uv run <python-file>`
- Run a Jupyter Lab server using the local environment with `uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab`
